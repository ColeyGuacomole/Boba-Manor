            You enter the room that the monster came out of.
            It must be the dining room, as there's a long table in the center of it. 
            There's a single candle that smells like coffee grounds in the middle, illuminating a large circle around it.
            On the other side of the table, theres a door that you can hear thumping behind. 
            On the left of the table, there's a giant painting of what looks like a horrific boba abomination.
