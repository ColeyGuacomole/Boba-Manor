            You follow the right wall with your hand. You hit an inwards corner and keep going. 
            Suddenly your hand pushes forwards and you almost fall onto the ground. You stand up and find yourself in a dimly lit room.
            This must be the dining room, as there's a long table in the center of it. 
            There's a single candle that smells like coffee grounds in the middle, illuminating a large circle around it.
            On the other side of the table, theres a door that you can hear thumping behind. 
            On the left of the table, there's a giant painting of what looks like a horrific boba abomination.
