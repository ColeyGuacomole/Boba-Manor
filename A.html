            Nothing. The doors are very sturdy for a dilapidated house, and no one came to answer you.
            You turn around to look for anothing way. You see a dim light coming from a room on the right. 
            As you walk towards it, the room darkens and you see two white dots appear in the room. They seem to be moving towards you.
