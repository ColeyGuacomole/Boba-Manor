            You hold the mug, slightly shaking and spilling a bit on your arm. 
            The monster opens the door and you finally get a good look at its body. 
            The monster has a humanoid structure, with a face 
            It is a dim purple like taro and has black boba scales imbeded into its skin.
            You yell and splash the coffee right into its deformed face. It screams in agony and starts to melt into the ground.
            You run past it and hear thousands of boba bubbles crash onto the floor. 
            Coffee beats boba apparantly. All that's left of the creature is a curled hand attached to an arm stump.
