            You wake up, and a great grin crawls up your mouth.
            You are one of them now. The feeling of this new body is awful. Your arms and legs are contorted and have hundreds of boba bubbles imbedded in them.
            Yet despite this, you are happier than you have ever been.
            You are ready to spend the rest of eternity in Boba Manor.
