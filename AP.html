            Go into the next room
        </a>
        <div>
            You turn to run the opposite direction, hoping for a room to be on the left. 
            A heavy, wet laughter booms from behind you. You almost slip because of a pile of boba bubbles on the ground.
            Why are there so many? Holding your hands out in front of yourself, you feel for a wall or doorknob.
            You get lucky and slip into another room. 
            Quickly feeling for a doorknob you find one and slam the door before whatever that creature was could get to you.
            You lock yourself in. 
            This room is better lit. Viewing it, you see a bed, a door to another room, and a barricaded window.
            You hear the door behind you crunching.
