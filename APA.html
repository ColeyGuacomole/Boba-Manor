            Just as you run across the room and open the door, the creature destroys the bedroom door.
            The next room is a dead end. This room is much smaller. It has a table sitting on a rug. 
            On the table there is a single mug of the darkest coffee you've ever seen.
            The monster must've seen you enter this room because you hear another muffled laugh from behind the door.

            Pull out the rug, looking for a hidden trapdoor.

            Return to entrance
