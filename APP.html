            Walk back into the main room, looking for the room on the right.
        </a>
        <div>
            You hide underneath the bed. Right as your left foot wiggles under, you hear the door collapse.
            Holding your breath, you get a glimpse of the horrendous appearance of the Boba Man. His feet are a dim purple like taro
            and have icy claws poking upwards out of each of its toes. It turns around, emits a wet grunt, and stomps out of the room.
            You wait a while and the exit the bed. 
        </div>
        <a id="b2", href="APPP.html">

            Try to escape through the window.
        </a>
        <a id="return" href="index.html">
            Return to entrance
