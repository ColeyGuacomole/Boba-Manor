            You enter the manor, and notice that small black dots line the walls.
            Before you can investigate them further, a giant crashing sound booms from above, and you rush inside to see a massive pile of black dots land where you were just standing.
            These black dots are boba bubbles. Thousands upon thousands of them, in and on everything in this place.
            You try to run out, past the pile, but the doors of the manor shut in your face.
            Now in complete darkness, you are faced with a decision.

            Follow the walls with your hand
        </a>
        <a id="return" href="index.html">
            Return to entrance
