            You examine the painting and discover that there's a tunnel behind it.
            You crawl through the tunnel, and notice it start to tighten.
            It's getting hard to breathe, but you continue and finally there's an opening.
            You can now crouch through, and eventually walk through the tunnel. It keeps branching off into more and more tunnels.
            At each branch you pick whichever one feels right.
            Finally, after what feels like an hour, you reach a door. 
            You open it and discover your bedroom sitting right there.
            You walk into it and turn around to shut the door, but there was no door.
            Has this all been a dream, or is there a bit of boba in us all?
            You decide never to drink boba tea again, and stick to coffee.
            You've escaped Boba Manor!
