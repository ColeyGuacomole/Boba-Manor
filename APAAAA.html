            You grab its arm, careful not to touch its hand. To your horror, your fingers begin to turn black and fall off as boba bubbles.
            It continues into your arm, and you feel like someone is ripping your arm off. Your vision darkens as you collapse from the pain,
            a victim of the last trick of the Boba Monster.         
        </div>
