            You pull out the rug, but nothing is under the table.
            The monster opens the door and you finally get a good look at its body. 
            The monster has a humanoid structure, with a face 
            It is a dim purple like taro and has black boba scales imbeded into its skin.
            It steps into the room and onto the room you just tossed away. The rug quickly crumbles into black boba bubbles.
            It takes a step forwards and you take one back. 
            There's no running. You accept your gruesome fate as you too crumble into boba bubbles.
