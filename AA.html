            You feel around the ground for a weapon and find a wooden board. You pick it up swing at the white dots. 
            The board crumbles into a thousand boba bubbles. You try to run but slip on the bubbles. 
            The white dots were eyes of the Boba Man. He grabs you on the back and picks you up. 
            The last thing you see are those glowing white dots.    
            The pain is immense as you feel your flesh begin to turn into boba bubbles. Don't let the Boba Monster get you.
