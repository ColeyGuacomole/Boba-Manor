        <div>
            You get a queasy feeling from looking at the arm, so you decide not to grab it.
            Feeling triumphant, you turn back into the bedroom. The boards on the window are surprisingly loose and come off with ease.
            You quickly climb out the window and run as fast as you can. You've just escaped Boba Manor!

            Return to entrance. You don't feel done with this place.
