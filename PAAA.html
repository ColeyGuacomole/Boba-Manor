            You glimpse into the door behind.
            There are hundreds of white glowing eyeballs in there.
            You slam the door and hear the gross, wet noise of them rushing to the door.
            You turn to run but slip on the boba bubbles left by the boba monster.
            You try to get up but stumble on the bubbles again.
            They've reached you. More and more monsters are appearing and begin to bobafy you.
            The pain of them tearing you apart and turning you into boba makes you go unconcious.
